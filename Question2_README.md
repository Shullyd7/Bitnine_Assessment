# Fibonacci Program

This program implements the Fibonacci sequence using three different approaches: recursive, memoization, and iterative.
It calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input value of n.

## Development Environment

- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: Windows 10

## How to Compile

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.

3. Run the following command to compile the source code:
   gcc Question2.c -o question2.exe

4. After successful compilation, run the executable file using the following command:
    C:\path\to\directory\question2.exe


## Notes
- Ensure that you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system before compiling the code.
- The program is designed to work for non-negative integer values of n.
- For very large values of n, the recursive approach may be slow or may cause stack overflow errors.
