# Fibonacci Calculation

This project provides a C implementation to calculate the Fibonacci sequence based on arithmetic operations and conditions. It utilizes dynamic programming for efficient computation.

## Development Environment

The source code for this project was developed and tested using the following environment:

- Operating System: Windows 10
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the source code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.

3. Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command. For example, with GCC:
   gcc Question1.c -o question1.exe

4. After successful compilation, run the executable file using the following command:
    C:\path\to\directory\question1.exe


The program will then execute, and the output will be displayed in the terminal.

## Output

The program will calculate and display the Fibonacci sequence based on the given arithmetic operations and conditions


## Notes
- Ensure that you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system before compiling the code.
